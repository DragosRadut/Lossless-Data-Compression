# Lossless-Data-Compression
Implementation provides an demonstational approach of in use compression methods.
` Comparative analysis and detailed explanation : [Algorithm-Analysis.pdf](./Algorithm-Analysis.pdf) `

## Running
``` 
make run-huff (Huffman's method)
make run-lz77 (LZ77 method)
```
Both run rules use **run_all.py**. Encoded binary files are stored in **out** directory. Decoded files are stored in **decompressed** directory. Test are found in **in** directory.
